# Autoland package 
This package was used for my bachelor thesis.
Developing a method for multirotors to land with centimeter accuracy in varrying conditions (fog, night etc..). Mainly aimed at agricultural applications.

This package is used in combination with a Swiftnaf piksi RTK GPS to accuratly monitor the position of the vehicle. 
The mavros stack is used to control the multirotor.

The entire stack is aimed to be ran on a companion computer (A raspberry PI).

The paper is included in the repository, for any additional questions you can contact me or create an github issue.
